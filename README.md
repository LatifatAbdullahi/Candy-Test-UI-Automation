### flows Automated and why

- I decided to automate the Login, chat with a companion and Search a profile
- For the Login, it is a repetitive flow for the Paid Users which is a common journey in order to access Paid benefits
- For the Chat flow, its the most important feature of the whole product
- For the Search a Profile, it is a common flow for finding preferred Profiles

### Structure Descisions made and Why


- I decided to use Page actions to allow clean, reusable and maintainable scripts.
- I decided to seperate my locators into a .json file to allow easy reusability and maintainability
- I decided to seperate the Login flow to present repetition for every test and allow a clean script.
- I decided to use a .env file to store my email and password used to run the tests to present exposure of secret info.
